# DocuSign for Salesforce Essentials

This is the new DocuSign for Salesforce base package. This is a lighter version of DFS that is installable on Salesforce Essentials organizations. This package also contains the Apex Toolkit.

[API Documentation and Code Examples](https://developers.docusign.com/salesforce/)

## Development Notes
Salesforce DX is used to build, test, and deploy this project.
1. [Install and configure Salesforce DX](./doc/sfdx.md).
2. Create a Developer scratch org or an Enterprise scratch org depending upon your use case.
- Developer scratch org: `sfdx force:org:create -f ./etc/developerScratch.json -s -a dfsle-scratch-org`. This org will allow creation of only 2 salesforce standard users associated with the scratch org.
- Enterprise scratch org: `sfdx force:org:create -f ./etc/enterpriseScratch -s -a dfsle-scratch-org`. This org will allow creation 10 salesforce standard users associated with the scratch org.
- Scratch orgs persist for 7 days by default. Use the `-d` parameter to set a custom expiration time. Customize aliases associated with scratch orgs in the command by changing `dfsle-scratch-org` to the desired value. 
3. Push the source to your scratch org: `sfdx force:source:push`.
4. Run post-install scripts in your scratch org: `sfdx force:apex:execute -f ./etc/postinstall.apex -u dfsle-scratch-org`.
5. To complete OAuth flows, you must create a password for your scratch org user: `sfdx force:user:password:generate -u dfsle-scratch-org`. Note the password returned by this command. If necessary, you can view the generated password later via `sfdx force:user:display -u dfsle-scratch-org`.

Once you have completed the initial scratch org setup, you can sync any local changes with that org using the `sfdx force:source:push`.

### Update: Shortcut Commands
1. In addition to using SFDX commands directly you can run "npm init" (if itâ€™s your first time running npm scripts on this package) then run "npm setup". The npm setup command will run all necessary commands for generating a sandbox/ configuration sequentially and prompt for responses as needed.

## Installing and running ESLint (pre-requisites : have npm installed)
To install ESLint in mac run - 'npm install'
To run linting run - 'npm run lint'.

## Testing Notes
- Run unit tests with coverage: `sfdx force:apex:test:run -c -r human -w 5`. This will wait 5 minutes for the test run to complete. You can also execute this command asynchronously by omitting `-w #`.
- Default test scratch orgs should use the configuration located at `etc/test.json`.
- You will need a password for your scratch org user to complete setup OAuth flows. See *Development Notes* for details.

## Packaging Notes
Until Salesforce 2nd Generation packages (2GP) is GA, we will continue manually uploading new package versions on our packaging org.
1. Connect the packaging org: `sfdx force:auth:web:login -a dfsle-packaging-org`. This is a one-time step. You can use whatever alias you desire.
1. Deploy the code: `sfdx force:source:deploy -u dfsle-packaging-org -p ./pkg -w 15`. This will wait 15 minutes for the deployment to complete. You can also execute this command asynchronously by omitting `-w #`.

When uploading the managed package, you must set the post-install splash page. From the upload screen:

1. Under "Post Install Instructions", select "Visualforce Page".
1. Under "Post Install Page", select "DocuSign Setup Splash Page [dfsle__SetupSplash]"
1. Click "Upload".

## DX Notes
To clean up any leftover orgs/configs in your local mac
- Go to .sfdx folder in your home directory and clean up the .json files associated with the particular org causing the issue. No CLI command with DX yet to do the cleanup.
